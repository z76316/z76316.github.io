### About me

Iâ€™m Chia-Yuan (Scott) Chang, third-year Ph.D. student from the Department of [Computer Science and Engineering at Texas A&M University](https://www.tamu.edu/), advised by Dr. [Na Zou](https://nzou1.github.io/) and Dr. [Xia "Ben" Hu](https://cs.rice.edu/~xh37/index.html). 

My research interests include [Generative Model Applications](https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.01508), [Domain Generalization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.07181), [Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.00576), and [Fair Machine Learning in Healthcare](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.13790).

Recently, I've focused on data-centric solutions with generative models and context-length generalization of Large Language Models, making machine learning models more accessible to real-world applications.
